Ra√∫l Gomis is a software Team Leader @Gemalto who has been developing with Java/AngularJS for the last five years. He has contributed to improve the methodology and quality of software development through the analysis and implementation in different teams and working environments.
He is in love with Frontend technologies, software patterns and strongly believes that doing quality code will radically improve the productivity and would massively reduce the development costs of having software defects in production.
