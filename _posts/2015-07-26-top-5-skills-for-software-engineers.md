*Software engineers* are responsible for designing, developing, maintaining, testing, and evaluating software and systems that make computers or anything containing software work. Nowadays, *software engineering* is one of the most promising careers and it is easy to notice due to the huge quantity of job offers, headhunters, etc. out there. In some situations, the term *programmer* has been used as a pejorative term to refer to those building software products. In response, I really think that coding is just the one of the skills, but a software engineer is much more that *just programming*.
Here are the five of the most important skills and requirements you will need to consider if you want to become a software engineer:

### 1. Keep it simple
The KISS principle ("Keep it simple, stupid", as a design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960.) is a rule of thumb that is present in lots of areas. It was referred several times along the history: 

- "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" (Leonardo da Vinci)
- "It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away" (Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry)
- "Simplify, then add lightness" (Colin Chapman, the founder of Lotus Cars)

It states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. Software development is one of the fields in which is very well applied.

In the engineering field and specially in Software Engineering try not to reinvent the wheel and follow software patterns and architectural patterns that have been proven during years. 

### 2. Learn, learn, learn
I like a lot the this qoute: "Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young." (Henry Ford). If you really want to be a good software engineer you should be learning like crazy. Start getting used to learn one technology today and tomorrow learning one new technology because the first is already old fashioned: this happends in software engineering. However, the most important thing is to learn the basic concepts, the _essence_. Frameworks help us to ease our job, I really love them, but you should be asking the why, why the _black magic_ behind a particular framework works and how it was developed. 

I suggest that you look throught the source code of AngularJS to see how they implemented the two way databinding, to see how Spring Framework implemented the DI mechanism in Java, etc. I am pretty sure you will learn a lot from the source code. 

### 3. Be motivated


### 4. Pay attention to the details


### 5. Test, test, test


### 6. Be the best in refactoring
