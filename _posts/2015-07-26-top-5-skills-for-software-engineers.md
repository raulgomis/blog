*Software engineers* are responsible for designing, developing, maintaining, testing, and evaluating software and systems that make computers or anything containing software work. Nowadays, *software engineering* is one of the most promising careers and it is easy to notice due to the huge quantity of job offers, headhunters, etc. out there. In some situations, the term *programmer* has been used as a pejorative term to refer to those building a software product. In response, there are many people who think programming is just the one of the skills, but a software engineers is much more that *just programming*.
Here are the five of the most important skills and requirements you will need to consider if you want to become a software engineer:

### 1. Keep it simple
The KISS principle ("Keep it simple, stupid", as a design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960.) is a rule of thumb that is present in lots of areas. It was referred several times along history: 
- "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" (Leonardo da Vinci)
- "It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away" (Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry)
- "Simplify, then add lightness" (Colin Chapman, the founder of Lotus Cars)

It states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. Software development is one of the fields in which is very well applied.

In the engineering field and specially in Software Engineering try not to reinvent the wheel and follow software patterns and architectural patterns that have been proven during years. 

### 2. Learn, learn, learn


### 3. Be motivated


### 4. Seek for code excellence


### 5. Test, test, test
